## [mooody.fun](http://mooody.fun/)

Mooody is a todo list app that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Users can also mark tasks as complete and filter tasks by status. Each task has a mood associated with it, which is determined text sentiment. The mood is displayed as a color on the task card and also a criticality of the task.
